Together with other well -known research institutes on site, the city in the West Palatinate has been an impulse for AI far beyond the borders of Germany for over 30 years.<br/><br/>More information about the Trifels Spring School 2025 is available at<a href="http://trifels2025.kl.dfki.de" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">trifels2025.kl.dfki.de</a>.<br/><br/>
